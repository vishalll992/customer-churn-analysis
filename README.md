# Customer Churn & Retention Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn for a subscription-based business to understand why customers leave, estimate the revenue impact of churn, and recommend data-driven retention strategies.

Out of 668 customers, 95 have churned, resulting in an overall churn rate of **14.2%** — meaning approximately **1 in every 7 customers** leaves the service. This makes churn a meaningful business concern with direct implications for recurring revenue.

## Business Problem

The company operates on a subscription model and relies on recurring revenue. Customer churn reduces revenue stability and increases the cost of growth, as acquiring new customers is typically more expensive than retaining existing ones.

The objective of this analysis is to:
- Identify the key drivers of customer churn  
- Quantify the revenue at risk due to churn  
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention  

---

## Objectives

- Measure and understand the overall churn rate  
- Analyze customer characteristics and behaviors associated with churn  
- Identify high-risk customer segments  
- Estimate potential revenue loss from churned customers  
- Translate insights into practical retention strategies  

---

## Dataset Overview

- **Total customers:** 668  
- **Churned customers:** 95  
- **Churn rate:** 14.2%  

The dataset includes customer-level information relevant to subscription usage and retention behavior.

## Analysis Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Churn distribution and patterns  
   - Comparison of churned vs retained customers  

2. **Churn Driver Analysis**  
   - Identification of features strongly associated with churn  
   - Behavioral and demographic insights  

3. **Revenue Impact Estimation**  
   - Estimation of revenue at risk due to churn  
   - Business impact assessment  

4. **Retention Strategy Recommendations**  
   - Data-backed suggestions to reduce churn  
   - Focus on high-impact customer segments

## Key Insights (Example)

- Churn is concentrated within specific customer segments  
- Certain behavioral patterns are strongly correlated with higher churn risk  
- Reducing churn even marginally could result in meaningful revenue retention
